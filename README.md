In total, our dataset includes 31,673 vulnerability samples and 208,451 non-vulnerability samples, with 80% of the data sourced from real-world scenarios. This large-scale dataset ensures a balanced and realistic evaluation environment, enhancing the reliability and generalizability of our experimental results.

To address specific research questions (RQs), we utilized tailored subsets of this dataset:

- For **RQ1**:
The dataset encompasses 28 CWE categories.
It includes 4,591 vulnerability samples and 6,732 non-vulnerability samples.
- For **RQ2**:
The dataset comprises 27,418 vulnerability samples and 203,317 non-vulnerability samples.
- For **RQ3**:
The dataset includes 20 vulnerability samples across 12 CWE categories.
It also involves four popular open-source projects, each with over 8,000 forks.
- For **RQ4**:
It is based on the analysis of the experimental results from RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3.
There is no separate statistical range for this research question.
- For **RQ5**:
The dataset consists of 500 vulnerability samples and 500 non-vulnerability samples.
These samples are organized into five experimental subdatasets.
